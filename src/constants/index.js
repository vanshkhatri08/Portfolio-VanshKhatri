I am a dedicated and versatile front-end developer and tech enthusiast with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. With 1 year of experience, I have worked with a variety of technologies, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity about how things work, and it has evolved into a career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges.
I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions.
Outside of front-end development, I spend most of my time improving my Data Structures, Algorithms, and problem-solving skills.`;
